# Portal 2 assets for older branches (Source SDK 2013 and etc.)

* Converted all textures 
  * Also there's separate folder with all vmts for Mapbase (`SDK_` shader). So if you want to use this asset pack for your mod based on Mapbase, just copy everything from `materials_mapbase` to `materials` folder.
* Converted all models to `48 version` - [their sources (4,26 GB, in zip 454,5 MB)]().
* Fixed voice lines to be able play in game (other sounds is not included, you can copy them from Portal 2 install).


## Current issues/missing stuff:

* (missing) Blob textures (idk, i dont see reason to use them in the stock SDK).
* (issue) `$detail` textures with ssbump aren't work in Source SDK 2013:
